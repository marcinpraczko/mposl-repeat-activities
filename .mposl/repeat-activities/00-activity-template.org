** [0%] [0/2] Testing mposl-repeat-activities during development

- [ ] Load tmuxp sessions (from current folder for now)
- [ ] Run fzf on main window
  - [ ] Test create `new activity` based on current template - add date (timestamp)?
  - [ ] Test if FZF refreshed list

** [0%] [0/1] Testing mposl-repeat-activities during development       :docs:

This is just example for now how to work with this activity.
As I have limited time to work on this project - probably will be quick and dirty.
So above list should be used during development.

- [ ] Change this file for some generic - once main goal will be developped.
